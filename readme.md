### pyLoad Android Client (ICS)

The available **pyLoad** application for Android works great, but comes with a few drawbacks. On this fork, I'll improve the client to my and the community's ([issues](https://bitbucket.org/ranan/pyload-android/issues)) needs.

#### Planned enhancements:
* Modern UI (Android 4+ components)
* **ActionBar** integration
* add links via **Share option** (eg. Chrome/YouTube -> pyLoad)
* multiple server support
* tidy up the UI
